what a torment wouldst thou prove,\r\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,\r\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\r\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,\r\nAnd that thou teachest how to make one twain,\r\nBy praising him here who doth hence remain.\r\nTake all my loves, my love, yea take them all;\r\nWhat hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\r\nNo love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;\r\nAll mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.\r\nThen, if for my love, thou my love receivest,\r\nI cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;\r\nBut yet be blam\u2019d, if thou thy self deceivest\r\nBy wilful taste of what thyself refusest.\r\nI do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,\r\nAlthough thou steal thee all my poverty:\r\nAnd yet, love knows it is a greater grief\r\nTo bear love\u2019s wrong, than hate\u2019s known injury.\r\nLascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\r\nKill me with spites yet we must not be foes.\r\nThat thou hast her it is not all my grief,\r\nAnd yet it may be said I loved her dearly;\r\nThat she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\r\nA loss in love that touches me more nearly.\r\nLoving offenders thus I will excuse ye:\r\nThou dost love her, because thou know\u2019st I love her;\r\nAnd for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\r\nSuffering my friend for my sake to approve her.\r\nIf I lose thee, my loss is my love\u2019s gain,\r\nAnd losing her, my friend hath found that loss;\r\nBoth find each other, and I lose both twain,\r\nAnd both for my sake lay on me this cross:\r\nBut here\u2019s the joy; my friend and I are one;\r\nSweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.\r\nWhen most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,\r\nFor all the day they view things unrespected;\r\nBut when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\r\nAnd darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\r\nThen thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,\r\nHow would thy shadow\u2019s form form happy show\r\nTo the clear day with thy much clearer light,\r\nWhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\r\nHow would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made\r\nBy looking on thee in the living day,\r\nWhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shade\r\nThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\r\nAll days are nights to see till I see thee,\r\nAnd nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\r\nThose pretty wrongs that liberty commits,\r\nWhen I am sometime absent from thy heart,\r\nThy beauty, and thy years full well befits,\r\nFor still temptation follows where thou art.\r\nGentle thou art, and therefore to be won,\r\nBeauteous thou art, therefore to be assail\u2019d;\r\nAnd when a woman woos, what woman\u2019s son\r\nWill sourly leave her till he have prevail\u2019d?\r\nAy me! but yet thou might\u2019st my seat forbear,\r\nAnd chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,\r\nWho lead thee in their riot even there\r\nWhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\u2013\r\nHers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\r\nThine by thy beauty being false to me.\r\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\r\nInjurious distance should not stop my way;\r\nFor then despite of space I would be brought,\r\nFrom limits far remote, where thou dost stay.\r\nNo matter then although my foot did stand\r\nUpon the farthest earth remov\u2019d from thee;\r\nFor nimble thought can jump both sea and land,\r\nAs soon as think the place where he would be.\r\nBut, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,\r\nTo leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\r\nBut that so much of earth and water wrought,\r\nI must attend time\u2019s leisure with my moan;\r\nReceiving nought by elements so slow\r\nBut heavy tears, badges of either\u2019s woe.\r\nThe other two, slight air, and purging fire\r\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide;\r\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\r\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\r\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\r\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\r\nMy life, being made of four, with two alone\r\nSinks down to death, oppress\u2019d with melancholy;\r\nUntil life\u2019s composition be recured\r\nBy those swift messengers return\u2019d from thee,\r\nWho even but now come back again, assured\r\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me:\r\nThis told, I joy; but then no longer glad,\r\nI send them back again, and straight grow sad.\r\nMine eye and heart are at a mortal war,\r\nHow to divide the conquest of thy sight;\r\nMine eye my heart thy picture\u2019s sight would bar,\r\nMy heart mine eye the freedom of that right.\r\nMy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,\r\nA closet never pierc\u2019d with crystal eyes,\r\nBut the defendant doth that plea deny,\r\nAnd says in him thy fair appearance lies.\r\nTo \u2018cide this title is impannelled\r\nA quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;\r\nAnd by their verdict is determined\r\nThe clear eye\u2019s moiety, and the dear heart\u2019s part:\r\nAs thus: mine eye\u2019s due is thine outward part,\r\nAnd my heart\u2019s right, thine inward love of heart.\r\nBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\r\nAnd each doth good turns now unto the other:\r\nWhen that mine eye is famish\u2019d for a look,\r\nOr heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,\r\nWith my love\u2019s picture then my eye doth feast,\r\nAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart;\r\nAnother time mine eye is my heart\u2019s guest,\r\nAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part:\r\nSo, either by thy picture or my love,\r\nThy self away, art present still with me;\r\nFor thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\r\nAnd I am still with them, and they with thee;\r\nOr, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\r\nAwakes my heart, to heart\u2019s and eyes\u2019 delight.\r\nHow careful was I when I took my way,\r\nEach trifle under truest bars to thrust,\r\nThat to my use it might unused stay\r\nFrom hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\r\nBut thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\r\nMost worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\r\nThou best of dearest, and mine only care,\r\nArt left the prey of every vulgar thief.\r\nThee have I not lock\u2019d up in any chest,\r\nSave where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\r\nWithin the gentle closure of my breast,\r\nFrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;\r\nAnd even thence thou wilt be stol\u2019n I fear,\r\nFor truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\r\nAgainst that time, if ever that time come,\r\nWhen I shall see thee frown on my defects,\r\nWhen as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\r\nCalled to that audit by advis\u2019d respects;\r\nAgainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\r\nAnd scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,\r\nWhen love, converted from the thing it was,\r\nShall reasons find of settled gravity;\r\nAgainst that time do I ensconce me here,\r\nWithin the knowledge of mine own desert,\r\nAnd this my hand, against my self uprear,\r\nTo guard the lawful reasons on thy part:\r\nTo leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,\r\nSince why to love I can allege no cause.\r\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\r\nWhen what I seek, my weary travel\u2019s end,\r\nDoth teach that ease and that repose to say,\r\n\u2018Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!\u2019\r\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\r\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\r\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\r\nHis rider lov\u2019d not speed being made from thee.\r\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\r\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\r\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\r\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side;\r\nFor that same groan doth put this in my mind,\r\nMy grief lies onward, and my joy behind.\r\nThus can my love excuse the slow offence\r\nOf my dull bearer when from thee I speed:\r\nFrom where thou art why should I haste me thence?\r\nTill I return, of posting is no need.\r\nO! what excuse will my poor beast then find,\r\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\r\nThen should I spur, though mounted on the wind,\r\nIn winged speed no motion shall I know,\r\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace.\r\nTherefore desire, (of perfect\u2019st love being made)\r\nShall neigh, no dull flesh, in his fiery race;\r\nBut love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade-\r\nSince from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\r\nTowards thee I\u2019ll run, and give him leave to go.\r\nSo am I as the rich, whose blessed key,\r\nCan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\r\nThe which he will not every hour survey,\r\nFor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\r\nTherefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\r\nSince, seldom coming in the long year set,\r\nLike stones of worth they thinly placed are,\r\nOr captain jewels in the carcanet.\r\nSo is the time that keeps you as my chest,\r\nOr as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\r\nTo make some special instant special-blest,\r\nBy new unfolding his imprison\u2019d pride.\r\nBlessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\r\nBeing had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.\r\nWhat is your substance, whereof are you made,\r\nThat millions of strange shadows on you tend?\r\nSince every one hath, every one, one shade,\r\nAnd you but one, can every shadow lend.\r\nDescribe Adonis, and the counterfeit\r\nIs poorly imitated after you;\r\nOn Helen\u2019s cheek all art of beauty set,\r\nAnd you in Grecian tires are painted new:\r\nSpeak of the spring, and foison of the year,\r\nThe one doth shadow of your beauty show,\r\nThe other as your bounty doth appear;\r\nAnd you in every blessed shape we know.\r\nIn all external grace you have some part,\r\nBut you like none, none you, for constant heart.\r\nO! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem\r\nBy that sweet ornament which truth doth give.\r\nThe rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\r\nFor that sweet odour, which doth in it live.\r\nThe canker blooms have full as deep a dye\r\nAs the perfumed tincture of the roses,\r\nHang on such thorns, and play as wantonly\r\nWhen summer\u2019s breath their masked buds discloses:\r\nBut, for their virtue only is their show,\r\nThey live unwoo\u2019d, and unrespected fade;\r\nDie to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;\r\nOf their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:\r\nAnd so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\r\nWhen that shall vade, my verse distills your truth.\r\nNot marble, nor the gilded monuments\r\nOf princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;\r\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\r\nThan unswept stone, besmear\u2019d with sluttish time.\r\nWhen wasteful war shall statues overturn,\r\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\r\nNor Mars his sword, nor war\u2019s quick fire shall burn\r\nThe living record of your memory.\r\n\u2018Gainst death, and all oblivious enmity\r\nShall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room\r\nEven in the eyes of all posterity\r\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom.\r\nSo, till the judgment that yourself arise,\r\nYou live in this, and dwell in lovers\u2019 eyes.\r\nSweet love, renew thy force; be it not said\r\nThy edge should blunter be than appetite,\r\nWhich but to-day by feeding is allay\u2019d,\r\nTo-morrow sharpened in his former might:\r\nSo, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill\r\nThy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,\r\nTo-morrow see again, and do not kill\r\nThe spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.\r\nLet this sad interim like the ocean be\r\nWhich parts the shore, where two contracted new\r\nCome daily to the banks, that when they see\r\nReturn of love, more blest may be the view;\r\nAs call it winter, which being full of care,\r\nMakes summer\u2019s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\r\nBeing your slave what should I do but tend\r\nUpon the hours, and times of your desire?\r\nI have no precious time at all to spend;\r\nNor services to do, till you require.\r\nNor dare I chide the world without end hour,\r\nWhilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,\r\nNor think the bitterness of absence sour,\r\nWhen you have bid your servant once adieu;\r\nNor dare I question with my jealous thought\r\nWhere you may be, or your affairs suppose,\r\nBut, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought\r\nSave, where you are, how happy you make those.\r\nSo true a fool is love, that in your will,\r\nThough you do anything, he thinks no ill.\r\nThat god forbid, that made me first your slave,\r\nI should in thought control your times of pleasure,\r\nOr at your hand the account of hours to crave,\r\nBeing your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!\r\nO! let me suffer, being at your beck,\r\nThe imprison\u2019d absence of your liberty;\r\nAnd patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,\r\nWithout accusing you of injury.\r\nBe where you list, your charter is so strong\r\nThat you yourself may privilege your time\r\nTo what you will; to you it doth belong\r\nYourself to pardon of self-doing crime.\r\nI am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\r\nNot blame your pleasure be it ill or well.\r\nIf there be nothing new, but that which is\r\nHath been before, how are our brains beguil\u2019d,\r\nWhich labouring for invention bear amiss\r\nThe second burthen of a former child.\r\nOh that record could with a backward look,\r\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\r\nShow me your image in some antique book,\r\nSince mind at first in character was done,\r\nThat I might see what the old world could say\r\nTo this composed wonder of your frame;\r\nWhether we are mended, or where better they,\r\nOr whether revolution be the same.\r\nOh sure I am the wits of former days,\r\nTo subjects worse have given admiring praise.\r\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\r\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end;\r\nEach changing place with that which goes before,\r\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\r\nNativity, once in the main of light,\r\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,\r\nCrooked eclipses \u2018gainst his glory fight,\r\nAnd Time that gave doth now his gift confound.\r\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth\r\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty\u2019s brow,\r\nFeeds on the rarities of nature\u2019s truth,\r\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:\r\nAnd yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\r\nPraising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\r\nIs it thy will, thy image should keep open\r\nMy heavy eyelids to the weary night?\r\nDost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,\r\nWhile shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\r\nIs it thy spirit that thou send\u2019st from thee\r\nSo far from home into my deeds to pry,\r\nTo find out shames and idle hours in me,\r\nThe scope and tenor of thy jealousy?\r\nO, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:\r\nIt is my love that keeps mine eye awake:\r\nMine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\r\nTo play the watchman ever for thy sake:\r\nFor thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,\r\nFrom me far off, with others all too near.\r\nSin of self-love possesseth all mine eye\r\nAnd all my soul, and all my every part;\r\nAnd for this sin there is no remedy,\r\nIt is so grounded inward in my heart.\r\nMethinks no face so gracious is as mine,\r\nNo shape so true, no truth of such account;\r\nAnd for myself mine own worth do define,\r\nAs I all other in all worths surmount.\r\nBut when my glass shows me myself indeed\r\nBeated and chopp\u2019d with tanned antiquity,\r\nMine own self-love quite contrary I read;\r\nSelf so self-loving were iniquity.\r\n\u2018Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,\r\nPainting my age with beauty of thy days.\r\nAgainst my love shall be as I am now,\r\nWith Time\u2019s injurious hand crush\u2019d and o\u2019erworn;\r\nWhen hours have drain\u2019d his blood and fill\u2019d his brow\r\nWith lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn\r\nHath travell\u2019d on to age\u2019s steepy night;\r\nAnd all those beauties whereof now he\u2019s king\r\nAre vanishing, or vanished out of sight,\r\nStealing away the treasure of his spring;\r\nFor such a time do I now fortify\r\nAgainst confounding age\u2019s cruel knife,\r\nThat he shall never cut from memory\r\nMy sweet love\u2019s beauty, though my lover\u2019s life:\r\nHis beauty shall in these black lines be seen,\r\nAnd they shall live, and he in them still green.\r\nWhen I have seen by Time\u2019s fell hand defac\u2019d\r\nThe rich proud cost of outworn buried age;\r\nWhen sometime lofty towers I see down-raz\u2019d,\r\nAnd brass eternal slave to mortal rage;\r\nWhen I have seen the hungry ocean gain\r\nAdvantage on the kingdom of the shore,\r\nAnd the firm soil win of the watery main,\r\nIncreasing store with loss, and loss with store;\r\nWhen I have seen such interchange of state,\r\nOr state itself confounded to decay;\r\nRuin hath taught me thus to ruminate\r\nThat Time will come and take my love away.\r\nThis thought is as a death which cannot choose\r\nBut weep to have that which it fears to lose.\r\nSince brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\r\nBut sad mortality o\u2019ersways their power,\r\nHow with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\r\nWhose action is no stronger than a flower?\r\nO! how shall summer\u2019s honey breath hold out,\r\nAgainst the wrackful siege of battering days,\r\nWhen rocks impregnable are not so stout,\r\nNor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?\r\nO fearful meditation! where, alack,\r\nShall Time\u2019s best jewel from Time\u2019s chest lie hid?\r\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?\r\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\r\nO! none, unless this miracle have might,\r\nThat in black ink my love may still shine bright.\r\nTired with all these, for restful death I cry,\r\nAs to behold desert a beggar born,\r\nAnd needy nothing trimm\u2019d in jollity,\r\nAnd purest faith unhappily forsworn,\r\nAnd gilded honour shamefully misplac\u2019d,\r\nAnd maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,\r\nAnd right perfection wrongfully disgrac\u2019d,\r\nAnd strength by limping sway disabled\r\nAnd art made tongue-tied by authority,\r\nAnd folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,\r\nAnd simple truth miscall\u2019d simplicity,\r\nAnd captive good attending captain ill:\r\nTir\u2019d with all these, from these would I be gone,\r\nSave that, to die, I leave my love alone.\r\nAh! wherefore with infection should he live,\r\nAnd with his presence grace impiety,\r\nThat sin by him advantage should achieve,\r\nAnd lace itself with his society?\r\nWhy should false painting imitate his cheek,\r\nAnd steal dead seeing of his living hue?\r\nWhy should poor beauty indirectly seek\r\nRoses of shadow, since his rose is true?\r\nWhy should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,\r\nBeggar\u2019d of blood to blush through lively veins?\r\nFor she hath no exchequer now but his,\r\nAnd proud of many, lives upon his gains.\r\nO! him she stores, to show what wealth she had.\r\nIn days long since, before these last so bad.\r\nThus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\r\nWhen beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\r\nBefore these bastard signs of fair were born,\r\nOr durst inhabit on a living brow;\r\nBefore the golden tresses of the dead,\r\nThe right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\r\nTo live a second life on second head;\r\nEre beauty\u2019s dead fleece made another gay:\r\nIn him those holy antique hours are seen,\r\nWithout all ornament, itself and true,\r\nMaking no summer of another\u2019s green,\r\nRobbing no old to dress his beauty new;\r\nAnd him as for a map doth Nature store,\r\nTo show false Art what beauty was of yore.\r\nThose parts of thee that the world\u2019s eye doth view\r\nWant nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;\r\nAll tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,\r\nUttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\r\nThy outward thus with outward praise is crown\u2019d;\r\nBut those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,\r\nIn other accents do this praise confound\r\nBy seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\r\nThey look into the beauty of thy mind,\r\nAnd that in guess they measure by thy deeds;\r\nThen, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,\r\nTo thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\r\nBut why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\r\nThe soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\r\nThat thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,\r\nFor slander\u2019s mark was ever yet the fair;\r\nThe ornament of beauty is suspect,\r\nA crow that flies in heaven\u2019s sweetest air.\r\nSo thou be good, slander doth but approve\r\nThy worth the greater, being woo\u2019d of time;\r\nFor canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\r\nAnd thou present\u2019st a pure unstained prime.\r\nThou hast pass\u2019d by the ambush of young days,\r\nEither not assail\u2019d or victor being charged;\r\nYet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\r\nTo tie up envy evermore enlarged:\r\nIf some suspect of ill mask\u2019d not thy show,\r\nThen thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\r\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead\r\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\r\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\r\nFrom this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\r\nNay, if you read this line, remember not\r\nThe hand that writ it, for I love you so,\r\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\r\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\r\nO! if, I say, you look upon this verse,\r\nWhen I perhaps compounded am with clay,\r\nDo not so much as my poor name rehearse;\r\nBut let your love even with my life decay;\r\nLest the wise world should look into your moan,\r\nAnd mock you with me after I am gone.\r\nO! lest the world should task you to recite\r\nWhat merit lived in me, that you should love\r\nAfter my death,\u2013dear love, forget me quite,\r\nFor you in me can nothing worthy prove.\r\nUnless you would devise some virtuous lie,\r\nTo do more for me than mine own desert,\r\nAnd hang more praise upon deceased I\r\nThan loner truth would willingly impart:\r\nO! lest your true love may seem false in this\r\nThat you for love speak well of me untrue,\r\nMy name be buried where my body is,\r\nAnd live no more to shame nor me nor you.\r\nFor I am shamed by that which I bring forth,\r\nAnd so should you, to love things nothing worth.\r\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold\r\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\r\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\r\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\r\nIn me thou see\u2019st the twilight of such day\r\nAs after sunset fadeth in the west;\r\nWhich by and by black night doth take away,\r\nDeath\u2019s second self, that seals up all in rest.\r\nIn me thou see\u2019st the glowing of such fire,\r\nThat on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\r\nAs the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\r\nConsum\u2019d with that which it was nourish\u2019d by.\r\nThis thou perceiv\u2019st, which makes thy love more strong,\r\nTo love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\r\nBut be contented when that fell arrest\r\nWithout all bail shall carry me away,\r\nMy life hath in this line some interest,\r\nWhich for memorial still with thee shall stay.\r\nWhen thou reviewest this, thou dost review\r\nThe very part was consecrate to thee:\r\nThe earth can have but earth, which is his due;\r\nMy spirit is thine, the better part of me:\r\nSo then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\r\nThe prey of worms, my body being dead;\r\nThe coward conquest of a wretch\u2019s knife,\r\nToo base of thee to be remembered.\r\nThe worth of that is that which it contains,\r\nAnd that is this, and this with thee remains.\r\nSo are you to my thoughts as food to life,\r\nOr as sweet-season\u2019d showers are to the ground;\r\nAnd for the peace of you I hold such strife\r\nAs \u2018twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\r\nNow proud as an enjoyer, and anon\r\nDoubting the filching age will steal his treasure;\r\nNow counting best to be with you alone,\r\nThen better\u2019d that the world may see my pleasure:\r\nSometime all full with feasting on your sight,\r\nAnd by and by clean starved for a look;\r\nPossessing or pursuing no delight\r\nSave what is had, or must from you be took.\r\nThus do I pine and surfeit day by day,\r\nOr gluttoning on all, or all away.\r\nWhy is my verse so barren of new pride,\r\nSo far from variation or quick change?\r\nWhy with the time do I not glance aside\r\nTo new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\r\nWhy write I still all one, ever the same,\r\nAnd keep invention in a noted weed,\r\nThat every word doth almost tell my name,\r\nShowing their birth, and where they did proceed?\r\nO! know sweet love I always write of you,\r\nAnd you and love are still my argument;\r\nSo all my best is dressing old words new,\r\nSpending again what is already spent:\r\nFor as the sun is daily new and old,\r\nSo is my love still telling what is told.\r\nThy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\r\nThy dial how thy precious minutes waste;\r\nThe vacant leaves thy mind\u2019s imprint will bear,\r\nAnd of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\r\nThe wrinkles which thy glass will truly show\r\nOf mouthed graves will give thee memory;\r\nThou by thy dial\u2019s shady stealth mayst know\r\nTime\u2019s thievish progress to eternity.\r\nLook what thy memory cannot contain,\r\nCommit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\r\nThose children nursed, deliver\u2019d from thy brain,\r\nTo take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\r\nThese offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\r\nShall profit thee and much enrich thy book.\r\nSo oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,\r\nAnd found such fair assistance in my verse\r\nAs every alien pen hath got my use\r\nAnd under thee their poesy disperse.\r\nThine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing\r\nAnd heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\r\nHave added feathers to the learned\u2019s wing\r\nAnd given grace a double majesty.\r\nYet be most proud of that which I compile,\r\nWhose influence is thine, and born of thee:\r\nIn others\u2019 works thou dost but mend the style,\r\nAnd arts with thy sweet graces graced be;\r\nBut thou art all my art, and dost advance\r\nAs high as learning my rude ignorance.\r\nWhilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\r\nMy verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\r\nBut now my gracious numbers are decay\u2019d,\r\nAnd my sick Muse doth give an other place.\r\nI grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument\r\nDeserves the travail of a worthier pen;\r\nYet what of thee thy poet doth invent\r\nHe robs thee of, and pays it thee again.\r\nHe lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\r\nFrom thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,\r\nAnd found it in thy cheek: he can afford\r\nNo praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\r\nThen thank him not for that which he doth say,\r\nSince what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.\r\nO! how I faint when I of you do write,\r\nKnowing a better spirit doth use your name,\r\nAnd in the praise thereof spends all his might,\r\nTo make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.\r\nBut since your worth, wide as the ocean is,\r\nThe humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\r\nMy saucy bark, inferior far to his,\r\nOn your broad main doth wilfully appear.\r\nYour shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\r\nWhilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;\r\nOr, being wrack\u2019d, I am a worthless boat,\r\nHe of tall building, and of goodly pride:\r\nThen if he thrive and I be cast away,\r\nThe worst was this, my love was my decay.\r\nOr I shall live your epitaph to make,\r\nOr you survive when I in earth am rotten,\r\nFrom hence your memory death cannot take,\r\nAlthough in me each part will be forgotten.\r\nYour name from hence immortal life shall have,\r\nThough I, once gone, to all the world must die:\r\nThe earth can yield me but a common grave,\r\nWhen you entombed in men\u2019s eyes shall lie.\r\nYour monument shall be my gentle verse,\r\nWhich eyes not yet created shall o\u2019er-read;\r\nAnd tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,\r\nWhen all the breathers of this world are dead;\r\nYou still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,\r\nWhere breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\r\nI grant thou wert not married to my Muse,\r\nAnd therefore mayst without attaint o\u2019erlook\r\nThe dedicated words which writers use\r\nOf their fair subject, blessing every book.\r\nThou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\r\nFinding thy worth a limit past my praise;\r\nAnd therefore art enforced to seek anew\r\nSome fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\r\nAnd do so, love; yet when they have devis\u2019d,\r\nWhat strained touches rhetoric can lend,\r\nThou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz\u2019d\r\nIn true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;\r\nAnd their gross painting might be better usd\r\nWhere cheeks need blood; in thee it is abusd.\r\nI never saw that you did painting need,\r\nAnd therefore to your fair no painting set;\r\nI found, or thought I found, you did exceed\r\nThe barren tender of a poet\u2019s debt:\r\nAnd therefore have I slept in your report,\r\nThat you yourself, being extant, well might show\r\nHow far a modern quill doth come too short,\r\nSpeaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\r\nThis silence for my sin you did impute,\r\nWhich shall be most my glory being dumb;\r\nFor I impair not beauty being mute,\r\nWhen others would give life, and bring a tomb.\r\nThere lives more life in one of your fair eyes\r\nThan both your poets can in praise devise.\r\nWho is it that says most, which can say more,\r\nThan this rich praise, that you alone, are you,\r\nIn whose confine immured is the store\r\nWhich should example where your equal grew?\r\nLean penury within that pen doth dwell\r\nThat to his subject lends not some small glory;\r\nBut he that writes of you, if he can tell\r\nThat you are you, so dignifies his story.\r\nLet him but copy what in you is writ,\r\nNot making worse what nature made so clear,\r\nAnd such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\r\nMaking his style admired every where.\r\nYou to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\r\nBeing fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\r\nMy tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,\r\nWhile comments of your praise richly compiled,\r\nReserve thy character with golden quill,\r\nAnd precious phrase by all the Muses filed.\r\nI think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,\r\nAnd like unlettered clerk still cry \u2018Amen\u2019\r\nTo every hymn that able spirit affords,\r\nIn polished form of well-refined pen.\r\nHearing you praised, I say \u201Dtis so, \u2019tis true,\u2019\r\nAnd to the most of praise add something more;\r\nBut that is in my thought, whose love to you,\r\nThough words come hindmost, holds his rank before.\r\nThen others, for the breath of words respect,\r\nMe for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\r\nWas it the proud full sail of his great verse,\r\nBound for the prize of all too precious you,\r\nThat did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\r\nMaking their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\r\nWas it his spirit, by spirits taught to write\r\nAbove a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\r\nNo, neither he, nor his compeers by night\r\nGiving him aid, my verse astonished.\r\nHe, nor that affable familiar ghost\r\nWhich nightly gulls him with intelligence\r\nAs victors of my silence cannot boast;\r\nI was not sick of any fear from thence:\r\nBut when your countenance fill\u2019d up his line,\r\nThen lack\u2019d I matter; that enfeebled mine.\r\nFarewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\r\nAnd like enough thou know\u2019st thy estimate,\r\nThe charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;\r\nMy bonds in thee are all determinate.\r\nFor how do I hold thee but by thy granting?\r\nAnd for that riches where is my deserving?\r\nThe cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\r\nAnd so my patent back again is swerving.\r\nThy self thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,\r\nOr me to whom thou gav\u2019st it else mistaking;\r\nSo thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\r\nComes home again, on better judgement making.\r\nThus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\r\nIn sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\r\nWhen thou shalt be dispos\u2019d to set me light,\r\nAnd place my merit in the eye of scorn,\r\nUpon thy side, against myself I\u2019ll fight,\r\nAnd prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.\r\nWith mine own weakness being best acquainted,\r\nUpon thy part I can set down a story\r\nOf faults concealed, wherein I am attainted;\r\nThat thou in losing me shalt win much glory:\r\nAnd I by this will be a gainer too;\r\nFor bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\r\nThe injuries that to myself I do,\r\nDoing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\r\nSuch is my love, to thee I so belong,\r\nThat for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.\r\nSay that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\r\nAnd I will comment upon that offence:\r\nSpeak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,\r\nAgainst thy reasons making no defence.\r\nThou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,\r\nTo set a form upon desired change,\r\nAs I\u2019ll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,\r\nI will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;\r\nBe absent from thy walks; and in my tongue\r\nThy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\r\nLest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,\r\nAnd haply of our old acquaintance tell.\r\nFor thee, against my self I\u2019ll vow debate,\r\nFor I must ne\u2019er love him whom thou dost hate.\r\nThen hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;\r\nNow, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\r\nJoin with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\r\nAnd do not drop in for an after-loss:\r\nAh! do not, when my heart hath \u2018scaped this sorrow,\r\nCome in the rearward of a conquered woe;\r\nGive not a windy night a rainy morrow,\r\nTo linger out a purposed overthrow.\r\nIf thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\r\nWhen other petty griefs have done their spite,\r\nBut in the onset come: so shall I taste\r\nAt first the very worst of fortune\u2019s might;\r\nAnd other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\r\nCompared with loss of thee, will not seem so.\r\nSome glory in their birth, some in their skill,\r\nSome in their wealth, some in their body\u2019s force,\r\nSome in their garments though new-fangled ill;\r\nSome in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;\r\nAnd every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,\r\nWherein it finds a joy above the rest:\r\nBut these particulars are not my measure,\r\nAll these I better in one general best.\r\nThy love is better than high birth to me,\r\nRicher than wealth, prouder than garments\u2019 cost,\r\nOf more delight than hawks and horses be;\r\nAnd having thee, of all men\u2019s pride I boast:\r\nWretched in this alone, that thou mayst take\r\nAll this away, and me most wretched make.\r\nBut do thy worst to steal thyself away,\r\nFor term of life thou art assured mine;\r\nAnd life no longer than thy love will stay,\r\nFor it depends upon that love of thine.\r\nThen need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,\r\nWhen in the least of them my life hath end.\r\nI see a better state to me belongs\r\nThan that which on thy humour doth depend:\r\nThou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\r\nSince that my life on thy revolt doth lie.\r\nO what a happy title do I find,\r\nHappy to have thy love, happy to die!\r\nBut what\u2019s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\r\nThou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.\r\nSo shall I live, supposing thou art true,\r\nLike a deceived husband; so love\u2019s face\r\nMay still seem love to me, though altered new;\r\nThy looks with me, thy heart in other place:\r\nFor there can live no hatred in thine eye,\r\nTherefore in that I cannot know thy change.\r\nIn many\u2019s looks, the false heart\u2019s history\r\nIs writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.\r\nBut heaven in thy creation did decree\r\nThat in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;\r\nWhate\u2019er thy thoughts, or thy heart\u2019s workings be,\r\nThy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.\r\nHow like Eve\u2019s apple doth thy beauty grow,\r\nIf thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.\r\nThey that have power to hurt, and will do none,\r\nThat do not do the thing they most do show,\r\nWho, moving others, are themselves as stone,\r\nUnmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;\r\nThey rightly do inherit heaven\u2019s graces,\r\nAnd husband nature\u2019s riches from expense;\r\nThey are the lords and owners of their faces,\r\nOthers, but stewards of their excellence.\r\nThe summer\u2019s flower is to the summer sweet,\r\nThough to itself, it only live and die,\r\nBut if that flower with base infection meet,\r\nThe basest weed outbraves his dignity:\r\nFor sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;\r\nLilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.\r\nHow sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame\r\nWhich, like a canker in the fragrant rose,\r\nDoth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\r\nO! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.\r\nThat tongue that tells the story of thy days,\r\nMaking lascivious comments on thy sport,\r\nCannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;\r\nNaming thy name blesses an ill report.\r\nO! what a mansion have those vices got\r\nWhich for their habitation chose out thee,\r\nWhere beauty\u2019s veil doth cover every blot\r\nAnd all things turns to fair that eyes can see!\r\nTake heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;\r\nThe hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.\r\nSome say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;\r\nSome say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;\r\nBoth grace and faults are lov\u2019d of more and less:\r\nThou mak\u2019st faults graces that to thee resort.\r\nAs on the finger of a throned queen\r\nThe basest jewel will be well esteem\u2019d,\r\nSo are those errors that in thee are seen\r\nTo truths translated, and for true things deem\u2019d.\r\nHow many lambs might the stern wolf betray,\r\nIf like a lamb he could his looks translate!\r\nHow many gazers mightst thou lead away,\r\nIf thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!\r\nBut do not so; I love thee in such sort,\r\nAs, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\r\nHow like a winter hath my absence been\r\nFrom thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\r\nWhat freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!\r\nWhat old December\u2019s bareness everywhere!\r\nAnd yet this time removed was summer\u2019s time;\r\nThe teeming autumn, big with rich increase,\r\nBearing the wanton burden of the prime,\r\nLike widow\u2019d wombs after their lords\u2019 decease:\r\nYet this abundant issue seemed to me\r\nBut hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;\r\nFor summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\r\nAnd, thou away, the very birds are mute:\r\nOr, if they sing, \u2019tis with so dull a cheer,\r\nThat leaves look pale, dreading the winter\u2019s near.\r\nFrom you have I been absent in the spring,\r\nWhen proud-pied April, dress\u2019d in all his trim,\r\nHath put a spirit of youth in every thing,\r\nThat heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him.\r\nYet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\r\nOf different flowers in odour and in hue,\r\nCould make me any summer\u2019s story tell,\r\nOr from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\r\nNor did I wonder at the lily\u2019s white,\r\nNor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;\r\nThey were but sweet, but figures of delight,\r\nDrawn after you, you pattern of all those.\r\nYet seemed it winter still, and you away,\r\nAs with your shadow I with these did play.\r\nThe forward violet thus did I chide:\r\nSweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,\r\nIf not from my love\u2019s breath? The purple pride\r\nWhich on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells\r\nIn my love\u2019s veins thou hast too grossly dy\u2019d.\r\nThe lily I condemned for thy hand,\r\nAnd buds of marjoram had stol\u2019n thy hair;\r\nThe roses fearfully on thorns did stand,\r\nOne blushing shame, another white despair;\r\nA third, nor red nor white, had stol\u2019n of both,\r\nAnd to his robbery had annex\u2019d thy breath;\r\nBut, for his theft, in pride of all his growth\r\nA vengeful canker eat him up to death.\r\nMore flowers I noted, yet I none could see,\r\nBut sweet, or colour it had stol\u2019n from thee.\r\nWhere art thou Muse that thou forget\u2019st so long,\r\nTo speak of that which gives thee all thy might?\r\nSpend\u2019st thou thy fury on some worthless song,\r\nDarkening thy power to lend base subjects light?\r\nReturn forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,\r\nIn gentle numbers time so idly spent;\r\nSing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem\r\nAnd gives thy pen both skill and argument.\r\nRise, resty Muse, my love\u2019s sweet face survey,\r\nIf Time have any wrinkle graven there;\r\nIf any, be a satire to decay,\r\nAnd make time\u2019s spoils despised every where.\r\nGive my love fame faster than Time wastes life,\r\nSo thou prevent\u2019st his scythe and crooked knife.\r\nO truant Muse what shall be thy amends\r\nFor thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?\r\nBoth truth and beauty on my love depends;\r\nSo dost thou too, and therein dignified.\r\nMake answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,\r\n\u2018Truth needs no colour, with his colour fixed;\r\nBeauty no pencil, beauty\u2019s truth to lay;\r\nBut best is best, if never intermixed\u2019?\r\nBecause he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?\r\nExcuse not silence so, for\u2019t lies in thee\r\nTo make him much outlive a gilded tomb\r\nAnd to be praised of ages yet to be.\r\nThen do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how\r\nTo make him seem, long hence, as he shows now.\r\nMy love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;\r\nI love not less, though less the show appear;\r\nThat love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,\r\nThe owner\u2019s tongue doth publish every where.\r\nOur love was new, and then but in the spring,\r\nWhen I was wont to greet it with my lays;\r\nAs Philomel in summer\u2019s front doth sing,\r\nAnd stops his pipe in growth of riper days:\r\nNot that the summer is less pleasant now\r\nThan when her mournful hymns did hush the night,\r\nBut that wild music burthens every bough,\r\nAnd sweets grown common lose their dear delight.\r\nTherefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:\r\nBecause I would not dull you with my song.\r\nAlack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,\r\nThat having such a scope to show her pride,\r\nThe argument all bare is of more worth\r\nThan when it hath my added praise beside!\r\nO! blame me not, if I no more can write!\r\nLook in your glass, and there appears a face\r\nThat over-goes my blunt invention quite,\r\nDulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.\r\nWere it not sinful then, striving to mend,\r\nTo mar the subject that before was well?\r\nFor to no other pass my verses tend\r\nThan of your graces and your gifts to tell;\r\nAnd more, much more, than in my verse can sit,\r\nYour own glass shows you when you look in it.\r\nTo me, fair friend, you never can be old,\r\nFor as you were when first your eye I ey\u2019d,\r\nSuch seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,\r\nHave from the forests shook three summers\u2019 pride,\r\nThree beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn\u2019d,\r\nIn process of the seasons have I seen,\r\nThree April perfumes in three hot Junes burn\u2019d,\r\nSince first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.\r\nAh! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,\r\nSteal from his figure, and no pace perceiv\u2019d;\r\nSo your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,\r\nHath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv\u2019d:\r\nFor fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:\r\nEre you were born was beauty\u2019s summer dead.\r\nLet not my love be called idolatry,\r\nNor my beloved as an idol show,\r\nSince all alike my songs and praises be\r\nTo one, of one, still such, and ever so.\r\nKind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,\r\nStill constant in a wondrous excellence;\r\nTherefore my verse to constancy confined,\r\nOne thing expressing, leaves out difference.\r\nFair, kind, and true, is all my argument,\r\nFair, kind, and true, varying to other words;\r\nAnd in this change is my invention spent,\r\nThree themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.\r\nFair, kind, and true, have often lived alone,\r\nWhich three till now, never kept seat in one.\r\nWhen in the chronicle of wasted time\r\nI see descriptions of the fairest wights,\r\nAnd beauty making beautiful old rhyme,\r\nIn praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,\r\nThen, in the blazon of sweet beauty\u2019s best,\r\nOf hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,\r\nI see their antique pen would have express\u2019d\r\nEven such a beauty as you master now.\r\nSo all their praises are but prophecies\r\nOf this our time, all you prefiguring;\r\nAnd for they looked but with divining eyes,\r\nThey had not skill enough your worth to sing:\r\nFor we, which now behold these present days,\r\nHave eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.\r\nNot mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul\r\nOf the wide world dreaming on things to come,\r\nCan yet the lease of my true love control,\r\nSupposed as forfeit to a confined doom.\r\nThe mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,\r\nAnd the sad augurs mock their own presage;\r\nIncertainties now crown themselves assured,\r\nAnd peace proclaims olives of endless age.\r\nNow with the drops of this most balmy time,\r\nMy love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,\r\nSince, spite of him, I\u2019ll live in this poor rhyme,\r\nWhile he insults o\u2019er dull and speechless tribes:\r\nAnd thou in this shalt find thy monument,\r\nWhen tyrants\u2019 crests and tombs of brass are spent.\r\nWhat\u2019s in the brain, that ink may character,\r\nWhich hath not figured to thee my true spirit?\r\nWhat\u2019s new to speak, what now to register,\r\nThat may express my love, or thy dear merit?\r\nNothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,\r\nI must each day say o\u2019er the very same;\r\nCounting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,\r\nEven as when first I hallowed thy fair name.\r\nSo that eternal love in love\u2019s fresh case,\r\nWeighs not the dust and injury of age,\r\nNor gives to necessary wrinkles place,\r\nBut makes antiquity for aye his page;\r\nFinding the first conceit of love there bred,\r\nWhere time and outward form would show it dead.\r\nO! never say that I was false of heart,\r\nThough absence seem\u2019d my flame to qualify,\r\nAs easy might I from my self depart\r\nAs from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:\r\nThat is my home of love: if I have ranged,\r\nLike him that travels, I return again;\r\nJust to the time, not with the time exchanged,\r\nSo that myself bring water for my stain.\r\nNever believe though in my nature reigned,\r\nAll frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,\r\nThat it could so preposterously be stained,\r\nTo leave for nothing all thy sum of good;\r\nFor nothing this wide universe I call,\r\nSave thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.\r\nAlas! \u2019tis true, I have gone here and there,\r\nAnd made my self a motley to the view,\r\nGored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,\r\nMade old offences of affections new;\r\nMost true it is, that I have looked on truth\r\nAskance and strangely; but, by all above,\r\nThese blenches gave my heart another youth,\r\nAnd worse essays proved thee my best of love.\r\nNow all is done, have what shall have no end:\r\nMine appetite I never more will grind\r\nOn newer proof, to try an older friend,\r\nA god in love, to whom I am confined.\r\nThen give me welcome, next my heaven the best,\r\nEven to thy pure and most most loving breast.\r\nO, for my sake do you with fortune chide,\r\nThe guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\r\nThat did not better for my life provide,\r\nThan public means which public manners breeds.\r\nThence comes it that my name receives a brand,\r\nAnd almost thence my nature is subdu\u2019d\r\nTo what it works in, like the dyer\u2019s hand:\r\nPity me then and wish I were renew\u2019d;\r\nWhilst, like a willing patient, I will drink\r\nPotions of eysell, \u2018gainst my strong infection;\r\nNo bitterness that I will bitter think,\r\nNor double penance, to correct correction.\r\nPity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye\r\nEven that your pity is enough to cure me.\r\nYour love and pity doth th\u2019 impression fill\r\nWhich vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;\r\nFor what care I who calls me well or ill,\r\nSo you o\u2019er green my bad, my good allow?\r\nYou are my all the world, and I must strive\r\nTo know my shames and praises from your tongue;\r\nNone else to me, nor I to none alive,\r\nThat my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.\r\nIn so profound abysm I throw all care\r\nOf others\u2019 voices, that my adder\u2019s sense\r\nTo critic and to flatt\u2019rer stopped are.\r\nMark how with my neglect I do dispense:\r\nYou are so strongly in my purpose bred\r\nThat all the world besides methinks y\u2019are dead.\r\nSince I left you, mine eye is in my mind,\r\nAnd that which governs me to go about\r\nDoth part his function, and is partly blind,\r\nSeems seeing, but effectively is out;\r\nFor it no form delivers to the heart\r\nOf bird, of flow\u2019r, or shape which it doth latch.\r\nOf his quick objects hath the mind no part,\r\nNor his own vision holds what it doth catch;\r\nFor if it see the rud\u2019st or gentlest sight,\r\nThe most sweet favour or deformed\u2019st creature,\r\nThe mountain, or the sea, the day, or night,\r\nThe crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.\r\nIncapable of more, replete with you,\r\nMy most true mind thus makes mine untrue.\r\nOr whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,\r\nDrink up the monarch\u2019s plague, this flattery?\r\nOr whether shall I say mine eye saith true,\r\nAnd that your love taught it this alchemy,\r\nTo make of monsters and things indigest\r\nSuch cheubins as your sweet self resemble,\r\nCreating every bad a perfect best\r\nAs fast as objects to his beams assemble?\r\nO \u2019tis the first; \u2019tis flattery in my seeing,\r\nAnd my great mind most kingly drinks it up.\r\nMine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing,\r\nAnd to his palate doth prepare the cup.\r\nIf it be poisoned, tis the lesser sin\r\nThat mine eye loes it and doth first begin.\r\nThose lines that I before have writ do lie,\r\nEven those that said I could not love you dearer:\r\nYet then my judgment knew no reason why\r\nMy most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.\r\nBut reckoning Time, whose million\u2019d accidents\r\nCreep in \u2018twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,\r\nTan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp\u2019st intents,\r\nDivert strong minds to the course of altering things;\r\nAlas! why, fearing of Time\u2019s tyranny,\r\nMight I not then say, \u2018Now I love you best,\u2019\r\nWhen I was certain o\u2019er incertainty,\r\nCrowning the present, doubting of the rest?\r\nLove is a babe, then might I not say so,\r\nTo give full growth to that which still doth grow?\r\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds\r\nAdmit impediments. Love is not love\r\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\r\nOr bends with the remover to remove:\r\nO, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,\r\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;\r\nIt is the star to every wandering bark,\r\nWhose worth\u2019s unknown, although his height be taken.\r\nLove\u2019s not Time\u2019s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\r\nWithin his bending sickle\u2019s compass come;\r\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\r\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.\r\nIf this be error and upon me proved,\r\nI never writ, nor no man ever loved.\r\nAccuse me thus: that I have scanted all\r\nWherein I should your great deserts repay,\r\nForgot upon your dearest love to call,\r\nWhereto all bonds do tie me day by day;\r\nThat I have frequent been with unknown minds,\r\nAnd giv\u2019n to time your own dear purchased right;\r\nThat I have hoisted sail to all the winds\r\nWhich should transport me farthest from your sight.\r\nBook both my willfulness and errors down,\r\nAnd on just proof surmise accumulate.\r\nBring me within the level of your frown,\r\nBut shoot not at me in your wakened hate,\r\nSince my appeal says I did strive to prove\r\nThe constancy and virtue of your love.\r\nLike as, to make our appetites more keen,\r\nWith eager compounds we our palate urge,\r\nAs, to prevent our maladies unseen,\r\nWe sicken to shun sickness when we purge;\r\nEven so, being full or your ne\u2019er-cloying sweetness,\r\nTo bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;\r\nAnd, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness\r\nTo be diseas\u2019d, ere that there was true needing.\r\nThus policy in love, to anticipate\r\nThe ills that were not, grew to faults assur\u2019d,\r\nAnd brought to medicine a healthful state,\r\nWhich, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur\u2019d;\r\nBut thence I learn, and find the lesson true,\r\nDrugs poison him that so fell sick of you.\r\nWhat potions have I drunk of siren tears,\r\nDistilled from limbecks foul as hell within,\r\nApplying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,\r\nStill losing when I saw myself to win!\r\nWhat wretched errors have my heart committed,\r\nWhilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!\r\nHow have my eyes out of their sheres been fitted\r\nIn the distraction of this maddening fever!\r\nO benefit of ill, now I find true\r\nThat better is by evil still made better;\r\nAnd ruined love when it is built anew\r\nGrows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater,\r\nSo I return rebuked to my content,\r\nAnd gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.\r\nThat you were once unkind befriends me now,\r\nAnd for that sorrow, which I then did feel,\r\nNeeds must I under my transgression bow,\r\nUnless my nerves were brass or hammer\u2019d steel.\r\nFor if you were by my unkindness shaken,\r\nAs I by yours, you\u2019ve passed a hell of time;\r\nAnd I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken\r\nTo weigh how once I suffered in your crime.\r\nO! that our night of woe might have remembered\r\nMy deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,\r\nAnd soon to you, as you to me, then tendered\r\nThe humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!\r\nBut that your trespass now becomes a fee;\r\nMine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.\r\n\u2018Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,\r\nWhen not to be receives reproach of being,\r\nAnd the just pleasure lost which is so deemed\r\nNot by our feeling but by others\u2019 seeing.\r\nFor why should others\u2019 false adulterate eyes\r\nGive salutation to my sportive blood?\r\nOr on my frailties why are frailer spies,\r\nWhich in their wills count bad what I think good?\r\nNo, I am that I am, and they that level\r\nAt my abuses reckon up their own;\r\nI may be straight, they they themselves be bevel.\r\nBy their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown,\r\nUnless this general evil they maintain:\r\nAll men are bad, and in their badness reign.\r\nThy gift, thy tables, are within my brain\r\nFull charactered with lasting memory,\r\nWhich shall above that idle rank remain,\r\nBeyond all date, even to eternity:\r\nOr, at the least, so long as brain and heart\r\nHave faculty by nature to subsist;\r\nTill each to razed oblivion yield his part\r\nOf thee, thy record never can be missed.\r\nThat poor retention could not so much hold,\r\nNor need I tallies thy dear love to score;\r\nTherefore to give them from me was I bold,\r\nTo trust those tables that receive thee more:\r\nTo keep an adjunct to remember thee\r\nWere to import forgetfulness in me.\r\nNo, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change\r\nThy pyramids built up with newer might\r\nTo me are nothing novel, nothing strange;\r\nThey are but dressings of a former sight.\r\nOur dates are brief, and therefore we admire\r\nWhat thou dost foist upon us that is old;\r\nAnd rather make them born to our desire\r\nThan think that we before have heard them told.\r\nThy registers and thee I both defy,\r\nNot wondering at the present nor the past,\r\nFor thy records and what we see doth lie,\r\nMade more or less by thy continual haste.\r\nThis I do vow and this shall ever be;\r\nI will be true despite thy scythe and thee.\r\nIf my dear love were but the child of state,\r\nIt might for Fortune\u2019s bastard be unfathered,\r\nAs subject to time\u2019s love or to time\u2019s hate,\r\nWeeds among weeds, or flow\u2019rs with flowers gathered.\r\nNo, it was builded far from accident;\r\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\r\nUnder the blow of thralled discontent,\r\nWhereto th\u2019 inviting time our fashion calls.\r\nIt fears not policy, that heretic,\r\nWhich works on leases of short numb\u2019red hours.\r\nBut all alone stands hugely politic,\r\nThat it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.\r\nTo this I witness call the fools of time,\r\nWhich die for goodness, who have lived for crime.\r\nWere\u2019t ought to me I bore the canopy,\r\nWith my extern the outward honouring,\r\nOr laid great bases for eternity,\r\nWhich prove more short than waste or ruining?\r\nHave I not seen dwellers on form and favour\r\nLose all and more by paying too much rent,\r\nFor compound sweet forgoing simple savour,\r\nPitiful tghrivers, in their gazing spent?\r\nNo, let me be obsequious in thy heart,\r\nAnd take thou my oblation, poor but free,\r\nWhich is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,\r\nBut mutual render, only me for thee.\r\nHence, thou suborned informer! A true soul\r\nWhen most impeached stands least in thy control.\r\nO thou, my lovely boy, who in thy pow\u2019r\r\nDost hold time\u2019s fickly glass, his sickle hour,\r\nWho hast by waning grown, and therein show\u2019st\r\nThy lovers withering, as they sweet self grow\u2019st \u2013\r\nIf nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,\r\nAs thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,\r\nShe keeps thee to this purpose: that her skill\r\nMay time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.\r\nYet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;\r\nShe may detain, but not still keep, her treasure.\r\nHer audit, though delayed, answered muxt be,\r\nAnd her quietus is to render thee.\r\nIn the old age black was not counted fair,\r\nOr if it were, it bore not beauty\u2019s name;\r\nBut now is black beauty\u2019s successive heir,\r\nAnd beauty slandered with a bastard shame:\r\nFor since each hand hath put on Nature\u2019s power,\r\nFairing the foul with Art\u2019s false borrowed face,\r\nSweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,\r\nBut is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.\r\nTherefore my mistress\u2019 eyes are raven black,\r\nHer eyes so suited, and they mourners seem\r\nAt such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,\r\nSland\u2019ring creation with a false esteem:\r\nYet so they mourn becoming of their woe,\r\nThat every tongue says beauty should look so.\r\nHow oft when thou, my music, music play\u2019st,\r\nUpon that blessed wood whose motion sounds\r\nWith thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway\u2019st\r\nThe wiry concord that mine ear confounds,\r\nDo I envy those jacks that nimble leap,\r\nTo kiss the tender inward of thy hand,\r\nWhilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,\r\nAt the wood\u2019s boldness by thee blushing stand!\r\nTo be so tickled, they would change their state\r\nAnd situation with those dancing chips,\r\nO\u2019er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,\r\nMaking dead wood more bless\u2019d than living lips.\r\nSince saucy jacks so happy are in this,\r\nGive them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\r\nThe expense of spirit in a waste of shame\r\nIs lust in action: and till action, lust\r\nIs perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,\r\nSavage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;\r\nEnjoyed no sooner but despised straight;\r\nPast reason hunted; and no sooner had,\r\nPast reason hated, as a swallowed bait,\r\nOn purpose laid to make the taker mad.\r\nMad in pursuit and in possession so;\r\nHad, having, and in quest to have extreme;\r\nA bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;\r\nBefore, a joy proposed; behind a dream.\r\nAll this the world well knows; yet none knows well\r\nTo shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.\r\nMy mistress\u2019 eyes are nothing like the sun;\r\nCoral is far more red, than her lips red:\r\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;\r\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.\r\nI have seen roses damasked, red and white,\r\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks;\r\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight\r\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\r\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know\r\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound:\r\nI grant I never saw a goddess go,\r\nMy mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:\r\nAnd yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,\r\nAs any she belied with false compare.\r\nThou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,\r\nAs those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;\r\nFor well thou know\u2019st to my dear doting heart\r\nThou art the fairest and most precious jewel.\r\nYet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,\r\nThy face hath not the power to make love groan;\r\nTo say they err I dare not be so bold,\r\nAlthough I swear it to myself alone.\r\nAnd to be sure that is not false I swear,\r\nA thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,\r\nOne on another\u2019s neck, do witness bear\r\nThy black is fairest in my judgment\u2019s place.\r\nIn nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,\r\nAnd thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.\r\nThine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,\r\nKnowing thy heart torments me with disdain,\r\nHave put on black and loving mourners be,\r\nLooking with pretty ruth upon my pain.\r\nAnd truly not the morning sun of heaven\r\nBetter becomes the grey cheeks of the east,\r\nNor that full star that ushers in the even,\r\nDoth half that glory to the sober west,\r\nAs those two mourning eyes become thy face:\r\nO! let it then as well beseem thy heart\r\nTo mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,\r\nAnd suit thy pity like in every part.\r\nThen will I swear beauty herself is black,\r\nAnd all they foul that thy complexion lack.\r\nFor that deep wound it gives my friend and me!\r\nIs\u2019t not enough to torture me alone,\r\nBut slave to slavery my sweet\u2019st friend must be?\r\nMe from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,\r\nAnd my next self thou harder hast engrossed:\r\nOf him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;\r\nA torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed.\r\nPrison my heart in thy steel bosom\u2019s ward,\r\nBut then my friend\u2019s heart let my poor heart bail;\r\nWhoe\u2019er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;\r\nThou canst not then use rigour in my jail:\r\nAnd yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,\r\nPerforce am thine, and all that is in me.\r\nSo now I have confessed that he is thine,\r\nAnd I my self am mortgaged to thy will,\r\nMyself I\u2019ll forfeit, so that other mine\r\nThou wilt restore to be my comfort still:\r\nBut thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,\r\nFor thou art covetous, and he is kind;\r\nHe learned but surety-like to write for me,\r\nUnder that bond that him as fast doth bind.\r\nThe statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,\r\nThou usurer, that put\u2019st forth all to use,\r\nAnd sue a friend came debtor for my sake;\r\nSo him I lose through my unkind abuse.\r\nHim have I lost; thou hast both him and me:\r\nHe pays the whole, and yet am I not free.\r\nWhoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,\r\nAnd Will to boot, and Will in over-plus;\r\nMore than enough am I that vexed thee still,\r\nTo thy sweet will making addition thus.\r\nWilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,\r\nNot once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?\r\nShall will in others seem right gracious,\r\nAnd in my will no fair acceptance shine?\r\nThe sea, all water, yet receives rain still,\r\nAnd in abundance addeth to his store;\r\nSo thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will\r\nOne will of mine, to make thy large will more.\r\nLet no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;\r\nThink all but one, and me in that one Will.\r\nIf thy soul check thee that I come so near,\r\nSwear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,\r\nAnd will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;\r\nThus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.\r\nWill, will fulfil the treasure of thy love,\r\nAy, fill it full with wills, and my will one.\r\nIn things of great receipt with ease we prove\r\nAmong a number one is reckoned none:\r\nThen in the number let me pass untold,\r\nThough in thy store\u2019s account I one must be;\r\nFor nothing hold me, so it please thee hold\r\nThat nothing me, a something sweet to thee:\r\nMake but my name thy love, and love that still,\r\nAnd then thou lovest me for my name is \u2018Will\u2019.\r\nThou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,\r\nThat they behold, and see not what they see?\r\nThey know what beauty is, see where it lies,\r\nYet what the best is take the worst to be.\r\nIf eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,\r\nBe anchored in the bay where all men ride,\r\nWhy of eyes\u2019 falsehood hast thou forged hooks,\r\nWhereto the judgment of my heart is tied?\r\nWhy should my heart think that a several plot,\r\nWhich my heart knows the wide world\u2019s common place?\r\nOr mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,\r\nTo put fair truth upon so foul a face?\r\nIn things right true my heart and eyes have erred,\r\nAnd to this false plague are they now transferred.\r\nWhen my love swears that she is made of truth\r\nI do believe her, though I know she lies,\r\nThat she might think me some untutor\u2019d youth,\r\nUnlearned in the world\u2019s false subtleties.\r\nThus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,\r\nAlthough she knows my days are past the best,\r\nSimply I credit her false speaking tongue:\r\nOn both sides thus is simple truth suppress\u2019d.\r\nBut wherefore says she not she is unjust?\r\nAnd wherefore say not I that I am old?\r\nO, love\u2019s best habit is in seeming trust,\r\nAnd age in love loves not to have years told:\r\nTherefore I lie with her and she with me,\r\nAnd in our faults by lies we flatter\u2019d be.\r\nO! call not me to justify the wrong\r\nThat thy unkindness lays upon my heart;\r\nWound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:\r\nUse power with power, and slay me not by art,\r\nTell me thou lov\u2019st elsewhere; but in my sight,\r\nDear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:\r\nWhat need\u2019st thou wound with cunning, when thy might\r\nIs more than my o\u2019erpressed defence can bide?\r\nLet me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows\r\nHer pretty looks have been mine enemies;\r\nAnd therefore from my face she turns my foes,\r\nThat they elsewhere might dart their injuries:\r\nYet do not so; but since I am near slain,\r\nKill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.\r\nBe wise as thou art cruel; do not press\r\nMy tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;\r\nLest sorrow lend me words, and words express\r\nThe manner of my pity-wanting pain.\r\nIf I might teach thee wit, better it were,\r\nThough not to love, yet, love to tell me so;\r\nAs testy sick men, when their deaths be near,\r\nNo news but health from their physicians know;\r\nFor, if I should despair, I should grow mad,\r\nAnd in my madness might speak ill of thee;\r\nNow this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,\r\nMad slanderers by mad ears believed be.\r\nThat I may not be so, nor thou belied,\r\nBear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.\r\nIn faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,\r\nFor they in thee a thousand errors note;\r\nBut \u2019tis my heart that loves what they despise,\r\nWho, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.\r\nNor are mine ears with thy tongue\u2019s tune delighted;\r\nNor tender feeling, to base touches prone,\r\nNor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited\r\nTo any sensual feast with thee alone:\r\nBut my five wits nor my five senses can\r\nDissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,\r\nWho leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,\r\nThy proud heart\u2019s slave and vassal wretch to be:\r\nOnly my plague thus far I count my gain,\r\nThat she that makes me sin awards me pain.\r\nLove is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,\r\nHate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:\r\nO! but with mine compare thou thine own state,\r\nAnd thou shalt find it merits not reproving;\r\nOr, if it do, not from those lips of thine,\r\nThat have profaned their scarlet ornaments\r\nAnd sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,\r\nRobbed others\u2019 beds\u2019 revenues of their rents.\r\nBe it lawful I love thee, as thou lov\u2019st those\r\nWhom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:\r\nRoot pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,\r\nThy pity may deserve to pitied be.\r\nIf thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,\r\nBy self-example mayst thou be denied!\r\nLo, as a careful housewife runs to catch\r\nOne of her feather\u2019d creatures broke away,\r\nSets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch\r\nIn pursuit of the thing she would have stay;\r\nWhilst her neglected child holds her in chase,\r\nCries to catch her whose busy care is bent\r\nTo follow that which flies before her face,\r\nNot prizing her poor infant\u2019s discontent;\r\nSo runn\u2019st thou after that which flies from thee,\r\nWhilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;\r\nBut if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,\r\nAnd play the mother\u2019s part, kiss me, be kind;\r\nSo will I pray that thou mayst have thy \u2018Will\u2019,\r\nIf thou turn back and my loud crying still.\r\nTwo loves I have of comfort and despair,\r\nWhich like two spirits do suggest me still:\r\nThe better angel is a man right fair,\r\nThe worser spirit a woman coloured ill.\r\nTo win me soon to hell, my female evil,\r\nTempteth my better angel from my side,\r\nAnd would corrupt my saint to be a devil,\r\nWooing his purity with her foul pride.\r\nAnd whether that my angel be turned fiend,\r\nSuspect I may, yet not directly tell;\r\nBut being both from me, both to each friend,\r\nI guess one angel in another\u2019s hell:\r\nYet this shall I ne\u2019er know, but live in doubt,\r\nTill my bad angel fire my good one out.\r\nThose lips that Love\u2019s own hand did make,\r\nBreathed forth the sound that said \u2018I hate\u2019,\r\nTo me that languished for her sake:\r\nBut when she saw my woeful state,\r\nStraight in her heart did mercy come,\r\nChiding that tongue that ever sweet\r\nWas used in giving gentle doom;\r\nAnd taught it thus anew to greet;\r\n\u2018I hate\u2019 she altered with an end,\r\nThat followed it as gentle day,\r\nDoth follow night, who like a fiend\r\nFrom heaven to hell is flown away.\r\n\u2018I hate\u2019, from hate away she threw,\r\nAnd saved my life, saying \u2018not you\u2019.\r\nPoor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,\r\nThrall to these rebel powers that thee array,\r\nWhy dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,\r\nPainting thy outward walls so costly gay?\r\nWhy so large cost, having so short a lease,\r\nDost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?\r\nShall worms, inheritors of this excess,\r\nEat up thy charge? Is this thy body\u2019s end?\r\nThen soul, live thou upon thy servant\u2019s loss,\r\nAnd let that pine to aggravate thy store;\r\nBuy terms divine in selling hours of dross;\r\nWithin be fed, without be rich no more:\r\nSo shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,\r\nAnd Death once dead, there\u2019s no more dying then.\r\nMy love is as a fever longing still,\r\nFor that which longer nurseth the disease;\r\nFeeding on that which doth preserve the ill,\r\nThe uncertain sickly appetite to please.\r\nMy reason, the physician to my love,\r\nAngry that his prescriptions are not kept,\r\nHath left me, and I desperate now approve\r\nDesire is death, which physic did except.\r\nPast cure I am, now Reason is past care,\r\nAnd frantic-mad with evermore unrest;\r\nMy thoughts and my discourse as madmen\u2019s are,\r\nAt random from the truth vainly expressed;\r\nFor I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,\r\nWho art as black as hell, as dark as night.\r\nO me! What eyes hath Love put in my head,\r\nWhich have no correspondence with true sight;\r\nOr, if they have, where is my judgment fled,\r\nThat censures falsely what they see aright?\r\nIf that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,\r\nWhat means the world to say it is not so?\r\nIf it be not, then love doth well denote\r\nLove\u2019s eye is not so true as all men\u2019s: no,\r\nHow can it? O! how can Love\u2019s eye be true,\r\nThat is so vexed with watching and with tears?\r\nNo marvel then, though I mistake my view;\r\nThe sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.\r\nO cunning Love! with tears thou keep\u2019st me blind,\r\nLest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.\r\nCanst thou, O cruel! Say I love thee not,\r\nWhen I against myself with thee partake?\r\nDo I not think on thee, when I forgot\r\nAm of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?\r\nWho hateth thee that I do call my friend,\r\nOn whom frown\u2019st thou that I do fawn upon,\r\nNay, if thou lour\u2019st on me, do I not spend\r\nRevenge upon myself with present moan?\r\nWhat merit do I in my self respect,\r\nThat is so proud thy service to despise,\r\nWhen all my best doth worship thy defect,\r\nCommanded by the motion of thine eyes?\r\nBut, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind,\r\nThose that can see thou lov\u2019st, and I am blind.\r\nO! from what power hast thou this powerful might,\r\nWith insufficiency my heart to sway?\r\nTo make me give the lie to my true sight,\r\nAnd swear that brightness doth not grace the day?\r\nWhence hast thou this becoming of things ill,\r\nThat in the very refuse of thy deeds\r\nThere is such strength and warrantise of skill,\r\nThat, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?\r\nWho taught thee how to make me love thee more,\r\nThe more I hear and see just cause of hate?\r\nO! though I love what others do abhor,\r\nWith others thou shouldst not abhor my state:\r\nIf thy unworthiness raised love in me,\r\nMore worthy I to be beloved of thee.\r\nLove is too young to know what conscience is,\r\nYet who knows not conscience is born of love?\r\nThen, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,\r\nLest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:\r\nFor, thou betraying me, I do betray\r\nMy nobler part to my gross body\u2019s treason;\r\nMy soul doth tell my body that he may\r\nTriumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,\r\nBut rising at thy name doth point out thee,\r\nAs his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,\r\nHe is contented thy poor drudge to be,\r\nTo stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.\r\nNo want of conscience hold it that I call\r\nHer love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.\r\nIn loving thee thou know\u2019st I am forsworn,\r\nBut thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,\r\nIn act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,\r\nIn vowing new hate after new love bearing.\r\nBut why of two oaths\u2019 breach do I accuse thee,\r\nWhen I break twenty? I am perjured most;\r\nFor all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee\r\nAnd all my honest faith in thee is lost,\r\nFor I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,\r\nOaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,\r\nAnd, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,\r\nOr made them swear against the thing they see;\r\nFor I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,\r\nTo swear against the truth so foul a lie!\r\nCupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:\r\nA maid of Dian\u2019s this advantage found,\r\nAnd his love-kindling fire did quickly steep\r\nIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground;\r\nWhich borrowed from this holy fire of Love,\r\nA dateless lively heat, still to endure,\r\nAnd grew a seething bath, which yet men prove\r\nAgainst strange maladies a sovereign cure.\r\nBut at my mistress\u2019 eye Love\u2019s brand new-fired,\r\nThe boy for trial needs would touch my breast;\r\nI, sick withal, the help of bath desired,\r\nAnd thither hied, a sad distempered guest,\r\nBut found no cure, the bath for my help lies\r\nWhere Cupid got new fire; my mistress\u2019 eyes.\r\nThe little Love-god lying once asleep,\r\nLaid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,\r\nWhilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep\r\nCame tripping by; but in her maiden hand\r\nThe fairest votary took up that fire\r\nWhich many legions of true hearts had warmed;\r\nAnd so the General of hot desire\r\nWas, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.\r\nThis brand she quenched in a cool well by,\r\nWhich from Love\u2019s fire took heat perpetual,\r\nGrowing a bath and healthful remedy,\r\nFor men diseased; but I, my mistress\u2019 thrall,\r\nCame there for cure and this by that I prove,\r\nLove\u2019s fire heats water, water cools not love.
